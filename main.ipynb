    "### Running time analysis\n",
    "Here are the key observations:\n",
    "- each recursive call of the `recursive_LIS_help()` function makes $O(n)$ operations due to the `filter()` function that finds indices of characters preceding the current one\n",
    "- in the worst case scenario characters are in alphabetical order and at each recursive call the vector `small_predecessor` contains all the characters but the current one, so we make $n-1$ recursive call of size $1,2, \\dots ,n-1$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $f(n)$ be the number of nodes in the recursive tree on input $n$, we can write that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(n) = 1 + \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} f(i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We prove that $f(n) = O\\big(2^{n-1}\\big)$ by induction on $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The case $n=1$ is trivial. So suppose the claim to be true $\\forall k < n$, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    f(n) &= 1 + \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} f(i)\\\\\n",

    "Since we make $O(n)$ operation at each node, the total running time is clearly exponential.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main issue with this implementation is that we don't exploit the solution on subsequences but recompute them several times within different branch of the recursive calls.
